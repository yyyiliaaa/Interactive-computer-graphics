This is a simple animation by rolling a sphere with some user-interface capabilities. The ui options includes producing the shadow effect while rolling a sphere, shading and lighting, fog effects, blending, texture mapping, lattice effects, and a particle system for a firework effect.

The input files and .glsl files should be put into build->Debug.
